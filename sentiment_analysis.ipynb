However, this is just one way to define the thresholds for determining the overall sentiment of a sentence.

        "The `compound` score is calculated by the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from the `nltk` library using a rule-based approach. The analyzer uses a pre-defined lexicon of words that are labeled with their sentiment polarity (positive or negative) and intensity (how positive or negative the word is). The analyzer then calculates the sentiment of a given text by summing the sentiment scores of its individual words and normalizing the result to obtain a `compound` score that ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).\n",
